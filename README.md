**Description** 
<p> A 'math sheet/scrap paper'-like rice I made in bspwm. fully inspired by ChocolateBreads's "Trying something different" post.</p>

**information**
* **bar**     : eww
* **wm**      : bspwm
* **widgets** : eww
* **dock**    : eww
<br>

**other stuffs i wanna say :P**

* **the dock** : the purpose of that dock is to act as workspace indidcator. it can be toggled by hovering over the bottom edge of the screen.
* **Widgets**  : the widgets are configured in a 1600x900 resolution screen (wierd i know). you can change their positions by changing the x and y value in eww.yuck
* **Packages** : packages and updates info are meant to work with arch/arch based system only.
